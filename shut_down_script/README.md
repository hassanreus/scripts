#If you don't mind using a terminal, you can do it this way.

#Execute : sleep 2h 45m 20s && systemctl suspend -i

#It suspends your system in 2 hours, 45 minutes, 20 seconds.

#I wrote a script for getting a GUI like this:

#XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#Copy the content of the script below and save it in your home directory as fast_suspend.sh.

#aleady exists just copy it

#Additionally you can create a .desktop file to run it.

#Copy the text below and save it as fast_suspend.desktop.

#aleady exists just copy it

#Provide execution permission for both files - execute :

chmod a+x ~/fast_suspend.sh ~/Desktop/fast_suspend.desktop

#When you want to launch this window again, just double click on fast_suspend on the desktop.

#case Error

#right click fast_suspend.desktop , and choose Allow launching
